The AD principal is specified in the pvPara parameter. If the szPassword parameter in the PFXExportCertStoreEx function was an empty string or NULL and the dwFlags parameter was set to PKCS12_PROTECT_TO_DOMAIN_SIDS, that function randomly generated a password and encrypted it to the AD principal specified in the pvPara parameter. In that case you should set the password to the value, empty string or NULL, that was used when the PFX packet was created. The PFXImportCertStore function will use the AD principal to decrypt the random password, and the randomly generated password will be used to decrypt the PFX certificate.
